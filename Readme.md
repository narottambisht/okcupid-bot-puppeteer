# OKCUPID PUPPETEER BOT

This project is bootstraped from scratch.

## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own use, and the answer to that question
is usually **yes, with attribution**.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I
find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and
designing this iteration of my bot, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your
own.

## Prefered Node version 12.21.0

## Steps to start using this bot!!

1. Create a new file .env in the root of this project and copy the .env.example file into this newly created file of yours.
2. Replace your username/email and password in this file with valid credentials.
3. Run `npm install` and see to it the that puppeteer will install a chromium based webbrowser so have a stable internet connection for it.
4. Run it from CLI using `npm run dev` command.
